# UtilitiesScript
This repo contains my scripts to accelarate my daily work if you find usefull just use it ;)
I use bash/powershell/LINQPad to achieve some things

List of scripts:
* TailTheNewestLogFile.ps1
* resolvePath.linq
This small program opens TortoiseGit in blame mode with specific path.
Unfortunatlety VisualStudio  `$(ItemPath)` doesn't provide proper case-sensite path, so I change it and pass to tortoise process
